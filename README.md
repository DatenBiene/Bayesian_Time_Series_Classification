This repository contains two Bayesian methods for classifying univariate time series: a Bayesian K Nearest Neighborhood (BayKNN) and a Bayesian Hidden Mrkov Model (HMM).

Please Read the paper Bayseian_Time_Series_Classification.pdf explaining the implementation.

You can find the code of the Bayesian KNN in Bayesian_knn/BayKNN.py and the code of the Bayesian HMM in Bayesian_hmm/bayes_hmm.py. The code of the Bayesian KNN was done on top of the sktime package : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime
